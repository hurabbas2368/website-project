<h1 class="academy">ABOUT OUR ACAEDMY</h1>
<p class="about-content"> In the last three years PCB geared up towards enhancing the levels of excellence – in all spheres especially towards the development of infrastructure and establishment of NCA. The New Domestic Structure too is another step in that direction. We are quite optimistic that these steps would famously serve Pakistan Cricket in years to come.

Under the auspices of the Pakistan Cricket Board, PCB Cricket Coaching Academies are premiere facilities, which welcome gifted player from the regional, national as well as international cricket arenas, aimed directly at cricketers interested in furthering their professional acumen and learning from the best in the world (Pakistan’s own Ex-National Team Stars).

The new complex of National Cricket Academy contains all the modern facilities and reflects the Pakistani Architecture. National Cricket Academy (NCA) offers its entrants a unique combination of the most refined and effective coaching skill development programs found anywhere in the world today.

National Cricket Academy will also act as a finishing school for Pakistan “A” and various segments like U-15, U-17, U-19 that form part of this academy.

Vision Statement

National Cricket Academy envisions to act as an educational institution and a nursery to effectively tap and groom the young talent for the future. To have cricketers who right at the starting point of their career are aware of not just delicacy and refinement of the game but have the most modern outlook too.

National Cricket Academy is committed to make them strong, to think and act like leaders and to equip them with self-confidence in the face of adversity, on the field of play and off it.</p>

			<h2>PSL</h2>
			<p>The Pakistan Super League is a professional Twenty20 cricket league, founded on 9 September 2015 with five teams and now comprises six teams. Instead of operating as an association of independently owned teams, the league is a single entity in which each franchise is owned and controlled by investors.

The PSL season runs between the months of February and March, with each team playing matches in double round robin format; the top four teams with the best record qualify for the playoffs and culminates in the championship game, the PSL Cup Final. The league is based in the Pakistan Cricket Board office in Lahore.</p>

 <div class="footer-col">
			<h2>INTERNATIONAL CRICKET</h2>
			<p>As cricket being the most popular sport in the country the locals have been thriving to watch matches since 2009. In the past few years there has been a major progress in bringing international cricket back to Pakistan. Zimbabwe toured Pakistan in 2015, West Indies and Srilanka toured Pakistan in 2017-2018. PCB introduced Pakistan Super League in 2015 with its first addition in 2016. Through PSL several international players played in Pakistan and thus for the revival of cricket in Pakistan. International Test matches and One Day International matches are played between the Pakistan national team and foreign opponents regularly.</p>
</div>
	<div class="footer-col">
			<h2>DOMESTIC SYSTEM</h2>
			<p>The new cricket domestic structure splits the teams along provincial lines. Punjab is the largest province with over three-fifths of the population residing there. ... Sindh, Balochistan and KPK will have one team each while Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit Baltistan and Islamabad will have one association .
Well, yes, but this one might be different? Historically, the PCB has been revamping its domestic circuit every other year. The format of the first-class tournament has been tweaked with regions and departments playing separately one season and together another, like an on-off soap opera relationship.
